# lmkd psi mod(ified)

**A module that optimizes how Android manages background apps (lmkd)**

## Overview

An extension of the SkyScene Add-on, where it achieves the effect of improve how the system manages background apps by modifying memory management mechanisms (lmk, psi). And by improving background process management, it's possible to achieve a smoother and more energy-efficient system

If you want an optimization that improves the kernel's memory management behavior, check out the [SkyScene Add-on](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/SkySceneAddon), it specifically handles this aspect, such as swapping, reclaim, and others

It was intended to be a fork of [LMKD-PSI-Activator](https://github.com/lululoid/LMKD-PSI-Activator) that optimizes the LMKD PSI part more efficiently and better for Android multitasking. However, it became an original project due to the stark difference in optimization between the two modules

### Features

- **📂 Pure optimization, no placebo** - Pure memory management optimization module, not containing other placebo and supporting all mainstream platforms like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and many other platforms
- **🧣 Align with Google's behavior and standards** - Follow Google's guidelines and standards, allowing older devices to benefit from a modern LMKD PSI in an older environment, depending on the available parameters
- **🦺 Activate and use PSI, the modern mechanism for managing background processes** - Utilize the modern mechanism for lmkd, PSI (pressure stall information), allowing devices with compatible kernels to use this kill method instead of the standard minfree
- **❤️‍🩹 Reduce cache pressure to avoid false positives** - Do not look for solutions that free up resources immediately, as lmkd psi seeks efficient use, not availability
- **📊 Safe, efficient, and tested multiple times** -  SELinux can still be enabled

## Requirement

- Android 10 or higher
- Have PSI enabled in the kernel
- Have lmkd as the only LMK mechanism on the device
- Having ZRAM enabled in the kernel
- 3GB or more of RAM (Optional)

## Installation

- Install this module, restart your phone, wait 20 seconds before the final optimizations are applied, and voila, you can have fun with your device
- For lmkd, the algorithms below have these compression rates:
  - lz4, lzo, lz4kd, lz4k: 3x compression ratio
  - Lz4hc, lzo-rle, deflate: 4x compression ratio
  - Zstd, Zstdn: 5x compression ratio
  - Other algorithms: 2x compression ratio
- Other LMKs are not compatible, only lmkd is compatible
- On Android devices running version 14 or lower, the "psi + minfree + new strategy" model is used, while on Android devices running version 15 or higher, the "pure psi" model is used
- Devices with 2GB of RAM or less are GO devices, 3GB-4GB of RAM are low-end, 6GB-8GB is mid-tier, and 12GB or more is high-performance

### Suggestions for Complementary Modules

- [NoSwipeToKill](https://github.com/dantmnf/NoSwipeToKill): lsposed module by [dantmnf](https://github.com/dantmnf) to reduce the aggressiveness of HyperOS/MIUI in killing processes, recommended for users of Xiaomi ROMs that use lsposed
- [A1Memory](https://github.com/OneB1ank/A1Memory): A memory management module that implements an OEM-style memory management framework in the system server, allowing you to control certain parts of memory management more efficiently than modern Android. Exclusive to Android 8-14

@Iamlooper -- For the magisk MMT Reborn template. Thanks to the template, I was able to replace the old qti-mem-opt template and keep all the features without extra additions! Also now the cpu usage of the module has reduced by 2%, little but useful
